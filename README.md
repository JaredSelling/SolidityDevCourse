# SolidityDevCourse
The purpose of this repository is practice creating and deploying Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  The folder block-starter contains code for a full-fledged kick-starter clone which leverages the blockchain to create campaigns and promote transparent, traceable, and immutable usage of funding provided by backers.

There are 3 types of users in block-starter
1. The contract manager is the person who created the campaign.  They have the ability to create spending requests and finalize them once they have received sufficient approvals.
2. Approvers are accounts that have contributed some amount of ether to a campaign.  After contributing, they gain the ability to vote and approve spending requests from the manager.
